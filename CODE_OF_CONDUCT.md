# Bharat Bhakti Yatra Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of Bharat Bhakti Yatra, pledge to foster a harassment-free, inclusive, and spiritually uplifting community for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

Inspired by the principles of **Sanatana Dharma**, we commit to creating an open, compassionate, and harmonious environment that celebrates India’s diverse spiritual and cultural heritage.

## Our Standards

To nurture a positive and inclusive community, we encourage behaviors such as:

- Practicing compassion, empathy, and kindness toward all individuals.
- Respecting diverse perspectives, spiritual beliefs, and cultural practices.
- Offering and humbly accepting constructive feedback with grace.
- Taking responsibility for mistakes, offering sincere apologies, and learning from them.
- Prioritizing the collective well-being of the community, guided by unity and dharma.

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Use of inappropriate, offensive, or sexualized language or imagery.
- Trolling, derogatory remarks, personal attacks, or divisive comments.
- Any form of harassment, whether public or private.
- Sharing others’ private information (e.g., addresses or emails) without explicit consent.
- Conduct that disrupts the spiritual and professional harmony of the community.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Our community leaders are tasked with upholding these standards, ensuring a respectful and inclusive environment. They will take fair, transparent, and appropriate action in response to any behavior deemed harmful, offensive, or contrary to our values, communicating moderation decisions clearly when necessary.

Leaders may remove, edit, or reject contributions (e.g., comments, commits, issues) that violate this Code of Conduct, providing reasons for their actions to maintain transparency and trust.
